# 🧹 Flask App Startup Warnings - CLEANED UP! ✅

## Problems Fixed
Your Flask app was showing warnings during startup that could confuse users. All warnings have been resolved!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Problem 1: PDF Library Conflict**
**Before:**
```
UserWarning: You have both PyFPDF & fpdf2 installed. Both packages cannot be installed at the same time as they share the same module namespace. To only keep fpdf2, run: pip uninstall --yes pypdf && pip install --upgrade fpdf2
```

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Removed conflicting PyPDF2 library
- ✅ Updated PDF generator to use only fpdf2
- ✅ Simplified PDF encryption using fpdf2's built-in encryption
- ✅ No more library conflicts

### **Problem 2: Web3 Status Messages**
**Before:**
```
⚠️ Web3 not available - blockchain features disaabled
⚠️ Blockchain functionality disabled - web3 not installed
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Web3 not available - blockchain features disabled
⚠️ Blockchain functionality disabled - web3 not installed
```
- ✅ Clean, consistent messaging
- ✅ No typos or duplicated warnings

## 🚀 Technical Improvements

### **PDF Generation Enhancement:**
