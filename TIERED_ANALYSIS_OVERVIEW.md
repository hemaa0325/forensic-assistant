üéØ TIERED FORENSIC ANALYSIS SYSTEM - Overview
==============================================

Your forensic app now uses a sophisticated 2-level analysis approach that addresses your requirement for basic AI/manual detection plus detailed forensic analysis.

üîç BASIC LEVEL: AI vs Manual Detection
======================================

PRIMARY CLASSIFICATION (Fast & High-Level)
- ü§ñ AI Generated: Detects artificially generated images (GANs, diffusion models, etc.)
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Manually Edited: Identifies traditional photo manipulation (Photoshop, copy-paste, etc.)  
- ‚úÖ Likely Authentic: No significant manipulation indicators detected
- ‚ùì Mixed/Uncertain: Conflicting or unclear indicators

KEY AI DETECTION INDICATORS:
‚Ä¢ Suspiciously uniform noise patterns (too perfect)
‚Ä¢ Artificial frequency domain characteristics
‚Ä¢ Overly smooth gradients (unnaturally perfect)

KEY MANUAL EDIT INDICATORS:
‚Ä¢ Compression artifact inconsistencies (double JPEG)
‚Ä¢ Sharp transitions and copy-paste artifacts
‚Ä¢ Color histogram gaps and anomalies

üìä MEDIUM LEVEL: 10-Criteria Detailed Analysis
=============================================

SECONDARY VERIFICATION (Comprehensive & Detailed)
1. Metadata Consistency - EXIF data validation
2. Software Signature - Editing software detection
3. Noise Pattern - Regional noise analysis  
4. Lighting & Shadows - Illumination consistency
5. Edge Artifacts - Halo and blur detection
6. Resolution Uniformity - Quality consistency
7. Compression Artifacts - JPEG ghost detection
8. Histogram Anomalies - Color distribution analysis
9. ELA (Error Level Analysis) - Recompression errors
10. Camera Fingerprint - Sensor pattern analysis

üèÜ ANALYSIS FLOW
================

1Ô∏è‚É£ BASIC LEVEL runs first ‚Üí Primary classification
2Ô∏è‚É£ MEDIUM LEVEL provides detailed scoring ‚Üí Secondary verification
3Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL RESULT combines both levels ‚Üí Comprehensive assessment

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
===============
=== BASIC LEVEL CLASSIFICATION ===
Primary Detection: AI Generated
Confidence: 85%

Key Indicators:
- Suspiciously uniform noise pattern (std: 12.45)
- AI-like frequency pattern detected (uniformity: 1.23)

=== MEDIUM LEVEL DETAILED ANALYSIS ===
Suspiciousness Score: 6/10

Detailed Criteria Breakdown:
[CLEAN] Metadata Consistency: 0 - Metadata appears consistent
[SUSPICIOUS] Software Signature: 1 - Processing software detected: AI Studio
[SUSPICIOUS] Noise Pattern: 1 - Inconsistent noise levels detected
[CLEAN] Lighting & Shadows: 0 - Lighting appears consistent
... (and so on)

üéØ BENEFITS OF TIERED APPROACH
==============================

‚úÖ FASTER DETECTION: Basic level provides quick AI vs manual classification
‚úÖ BETTER ACCURACY: Different algorithms optimized for different manipulation types  
‚úÖ DETAILED INSIGHTS: Medium level provides forensic-grade detailed analysis
‚úÖ CLEAR REPORTING: Separates high-level classification from technical details
‚úÖ SCALABLE: Can add more detection algorithms to basic level as needed

üöÄ USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
========================

FOR QUICK SCREENING: Focus on Basic Level results
FOR FORENSIC EVIDENCE: Use Medium Level detailed breakdown
FOR COURT PROCEEDINGS: Include both levels for comprehensive documentation
FOR AI DETECTION: Basic Level is specifically tuned for AI vs human-made content

This tiered system ensures you get both the speed of high-level classification AND the depth of detailed forensic analysis!
